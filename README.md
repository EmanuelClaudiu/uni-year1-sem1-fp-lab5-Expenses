# uni-year1-sem1-fp-lab5-expenses
 App that manages expenses. This is the first time I've ever used layered architecture, aswell as modular programming.
  
Statement:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manage a list of expenses. Each expense has a day (integer between 1 and 30), amount of money (positive
integer) and expense type (string). Provide the user the following features:
- Add a new expense read to the list. Expense data is read from the console.
- Show the list of expenses on the console.
- Filter the list so that it contains only expenses above a certain value that is read from the console.
- Undo the last operation that modified program data. This step can be repeated.
